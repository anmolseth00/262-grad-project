The quantum Internet will\\nnot necessarily replace the (classical) Internet we know and\\nuse today, at least not in the near future, but can complement\\nthe current Internet. The quantum Internet aims to enable\\nrobust quantum teleportation (or transmission) of qubits,1\\nand entanglement among qubits,2 over long Internet-scale\\ndistances, which are key to many of the quantum protocols\\nincluding quantum key distribution, quantum voting, and\\nothers, as well as for non-local control of quantum gates.\\nThere have been efforts to build quantum computers,\\nand it remains to see if any one paradigm becomes the\\ndominant or best way of building such quantum comput-\\ners. At the same time, even as researchers develop more\\npowerful quantum computers (supporting more qubits for\\noperations, and at lower error rates), there is an opportunity\\nfor connecting multiple quantum computers from differ-\\nent sites to achieve much more complex quantum com-\\nputations, i.e., inter-linking multiple quantum computers\\non different sites to perform distributed computing with\\na distributed system of quantum computers (or quantum\\nprocessing units (QPUs) at different nodes), arriving at the\\nnotion of distributed quantum computing, e.g., [3].\\nWhile distributed quantum computing can involve mul-\\ntiple QPUs next to each other or at the same site, with the\\nquantum Internet, one can envision distributed quantum\\n•\\nSeng W.

A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, and can be\\nthought of as a two-state, or two-levelled, quantum-mechanical system,\\nsuch as an electron’s spin, where the two levels are spin up and spin\\ndown, or a photon’s polarization, where the two states are the vertical\\npolarization and the horizontal polarization.\\n2. Multiple qubits at different sites can share an entangled state, a\\nsuperpositon of “specially correlated” states, to be used in distributed\\nalgorithms.\\ncomputing over nodes geographically far apart. As noted\\nin [4], the idea is the quantum Internet as the “underly-\\ning infrastructure of the Distributed Quantum Computing\\necosystem.”\\nThis article highlights the emerging area of distributed\\nquantum computing over the quantum Internet, which we\\nrefer to as quantum Internet computing, i.e., the idea of com-\\nputing using quantumly connected distributed quantum\\ncomputers over Internet-scale distances. Hence, quantum\\nInternet computing is not a new concept in itself but a\\nproposed “umbrella term” used here for the collection of\\ntopics (listed below), from an analogy to (classical) Internet\\ncomputing.\\nInternet computing, where one does distributed comput-\\ning but over Internet-scale distances and distributed sys-\\ntems involve nodes connected via the Internet, is at the inter-\\nsection of work in (classical) distributed computing and the\\n(classical) Internet. Analogous to Internet computing, one\\ncould ask the question of what would be at the intersection\\nof work in distributed quantum computing and work on the\\nquantum Internet, which brings us to the notion of quantum\\nInternet computing.\\nAlso, while the quantum Internet and distributed quan-\\ntum computing are still nascent research areas, there are at\\nleast three key topics which can be considered as relevant to\\nquantum Internet computing:\\n•\\ndistributed quantum computing, including quantum\\nprotocols from theoretical perspectives involving\\ncommunication complexity studies, and distributed\\nquantum computing via non-local or distributed\\nquantum gates,\\n•\\nquantum cloud computing with a focus on delegat-\\ning quantum computations, blind quantum comput-\\ning, and verifying delegated quantum computations,\\nand\\n•\\ncomputations and algorithms for the quantum Inter-\\nnet including key ideas such as quantum entangle-\\nment distillation, entanglement swapping, quantum\\nIEEE IOT MAGAZINE, VOL. XX, NO. X, X 2022\\n2\\nrepeaters, and quantum Internet standards.3\\nWe brieﬂy discuss the above topics in the following sections.\\n2\\nDISTRIBUTED QUANTUM COMPUTING\\nDistributed quantum computing problems and quantum\\nprotocols have been well-studied for over two decades,\\nfrom a theoretical computer science perspective,4 many of\\nwhich have their inspiration from classical distributed com-\\nputing research. Quantum versions of classical distributed\\ncomputing problems and protocols, and new forms of dis-\\ntributed computing using quantum information, have been\\nexplored, e.g., the distributed three-party product problem,\\nthe distributed Deutsch-Jozsa promise problem and the\\ndistributed intersection problem, demonstrating how, for\\nsome problems, quantum information can enable fewer\\nbits of communication to be used for a solution, and how\\ncertain distributed computation problems can be solved\\nwith quantum information, but cannot be solved classically.\\nMany quantum protocols, including quantum coin ﬂipping,\\nquantum leader election, quantum anonymous broadcast-\\ning, quantum voting, quantum Byzantine Generals, quan-\\ntum secret sharing, and quantum oblivious transfer, can\\nbe viewed as “quantum versions” of classical distributed\\ncomputing problems, and have been studied extensively.\\nAnother area of study, which has also been considered\\nas distributed quantum computing, is non-local gates, or\\nthe non-local control of quantum gates, including early\\nwork nearly over two decades ago.5 Key to performing\\nsuch non-local control of quantum gates is the use of en-\\ntanglement, which can be viewed as a resource for such\\nnon-local computations. More recent work has looked at\\nhow to partition the computations of distributed quantum\\ncircuits over multiple QPUs, e.g., [3] as we mentioned earlier\\n- with considerations including distributing computations\\nin such a way as to optimize performance and to reduce the\\nrequirements on entanglement, since if the entanglements\\nrequired are generated at too low a rate, this will hold up\\ncomputations. The key motivation here is to inter-link a\\nset of quantum computers to form effectively a much more\\npowerful quantum computer.\\n3\\nQUANTUM CLOUD COMPUTING AND DELEGAT-\\nING QUANTUM COMPUTATIONS\\nWe have seen big tech companies and startups offering\\nquantum computing as a service similar to accessing other\\ncloud service offerings, which is a fantastic resource for\\nexperimentation and studies.\\nMore formally, studies into delegating quantum com-\\nputation from a client (which can be either classical, or\\nalmost classical, i.e., with minimal capability to perform\\n3. For example, see https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-qirg-principles-10.html\\n[last accessed: 1/8/2022]\\n4. For example, see Buhrman and R¨\\nohrig’s paper dating back to\\n2003: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45138-9 1\\n[last accessed: 1/8/2022]\\n5. For example, see the work by Yimsiriwattana and Lomonaco\\nJr.\\nin\\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0402148.pdf\\nand\\na\\ndistributed\\nversion\\nof\\nShor’s\\nfamous\\nfactorization\\nalgorithm\\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05976 [last accessed: 1/8/2022]\\ncomputations such as teleporting qubits, applying simple\\nPauli quantum operations, and doing basic measurements)\\nwhich is much more restricted than the server (assumed\\nto be a universal quantum computer) have been studied,\\ncalled delegated quantum computing. And when the server\\nis prevented from knowing the client’s inputs but still can\\nperform delegated computations, by a technique such as\\nthe quantum one-time pad (where the client applies Pauli\\noperations to add uncertainty from the server’s perspective,\\nthereby effectively encrypting the quantum inputs it sends\\nto the server, and keeps track of operations it later needs\\nto decrypt the outputs from the server), this is called blind\\nquantum computing.\\nIn order to be sure that the server does indeed perform\\nthe required quantum operations delegated to it by the\\nclient, the client can embed tests (or test runs) into the\\ndelegated computations, so that the server (not being able\\nto distinguish between tests and normal computations) can\\nbe caught out if it did not perform the required compu-\\ntations properly. That is, the client can verify if the server\\nperformed the required quantum computations.6 Further\\nabstractions for delegating quantum computations with\\nsupporting cloud services continues to be investigated.\\n4\\nTHE QUANTUM INTERNET\\nAs we mentioned earlier, work on the quantum Internet\\nfocuses on how to efﬁciently enable robust entanglement\\nshared among qubits over long geographical distances. If\\ntwo nodes in different continents share entangled states,\\nthen, this can be a resource to do non-local gates, i.e.,\\nto perform distributed quantum compu'"
